If the data you want isn\u2019t available, what is? Just start.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Try it yourself: Experience your product or service personally. Listen to customer calls and engage with online self-help, loyalty programs or community sites. Identify pain points and gain empathy from standing in your customers shoes!\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Observation: Step outside your office and away from the spreadsheet\u2026 Go meet a customer, observe their environment and how they work.

I'm glad to hear that your webinar went well and that you've started building your community on Facebook. To increase the number of community members, consider implementing the following strategies:\n\n1. Leverage existing users: Send an email or in-app notification to your existing users, highlighting the benefits of joining the Facebook group. Offer exclusive content, special offers, or early access to new features as incentives.\n\n2. Promote on social media: Regularly promote your Facebook group on your company's social media channels, including Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Share engaging content from the group to attract new members.\n\n3. Cross-promotion: Collaborate with complementary businesses, influencers, or industry thought leaders to promote each other's communities. This can expand your reach and attract new members.\n\n4. Webinar follow-up: After each webinar, send a follow-up email to the attendees, thanking them for their participation and inviting them to join the Facebook group for further discussions and exclusive content.\n\n5. Add a call-to-action on your website: Place a prominent call-to-action (CTA) on your website, inviting visitors to join the Facebook group. Make sure to highlight the benefits of joining the community.\n\n6. Run Facebook ads: Target your existing users and potential customers with Facebook ads to promote the group. Make sure to refine your target audience and craft a compelling ad copy to attract new members.\n\n7. Engage existing members: Encourage current group members to invite their friends and colleagues who may benefit from the community. You can also create a referral program, offering incentives to those who bring new members to the group.\n\n8. Create valuable content: Ensure that your Facebook group offers valuable, exclusive content that is not available elsewhere. This will incentivize users to join and participate actively in the community.\n\n9. Host exclusive events: Organize online events, such as Q&A sessions, guest interviews, or workshops, exclusively for the Facebook group members. Promote these events across your channels to attract new members.\n\n10. Monitor and optimize: Regularly analyze the growth and engagement of your Facebook group. Adjust your strategies based on the performance and feedback from your community members."}, {"2mo": "Can GPT-4 replace human Growth Hacker?\n\nI hired GPT-4 as my growth hacker and told it to grow EngageAI to have a $10,000 MRR.\n\nI will do everything exactly as it told me and see if GPT-4 can grow the business.\n\nFollow to learn and see GPT-4 can replace human marketers.\n\n(Day 3 of 30)\n\n+++\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Exciting news!

You can download full movies in just seconds.\n\n- Latency is already low with 4G, but 5G will make it virtually zero.\n\nThis increased speed and decreased latency are what make this fifth-generation connectivity so much more powerful. This will make all the difference in the internet of things (IoT) revolution.\n\nAll the things that are connected will work seamlessly with each other making huge leaps in real-time analytics and automation.\n\nOn top of that, 4G can support only around 4,000 devices per square kilometre, whereas 5G will support around one million.\n\nAre you excited to have 5G?\n___\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Connect with me\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Click to Follow"}, {"2yr": "There have been so many people impacted by the covid19 & this includes many talented cloud & data analytics professionals.
